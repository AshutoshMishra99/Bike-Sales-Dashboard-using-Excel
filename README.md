## Project Overview

The Bike Sales Analysis Dashboard is a data analysis project aimed at understanding the demographic and behavioral factors affecting bike purchases. This project uses customer data to analyze relationships between factors like age, income, gender, commute distance, and bike purchase behavior.

The goal is to uncover insights that can help businesses optimize their marketing strategies and product offerings by targeting the right customer segments.

## Data Sources

The dataset used for this analysis includes information on:

- **Customer Demographics**: Age, gender, marital status, education level, and region.
- **Income Levels**: Customer income data.
- **Purchase Behavior**: Whether or not the customer purchased a bike.
- **Commute Distance**: The distance customers commute on a daily basis.

The dataset was pre-processed and cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy in the analysis.

## Analysis & Insights

The analysis was carried out using Excel, where data cleaning, exploration, and visualization were performed. Key steps in the process included:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing categorical variables.
2. **Data Exploration**: Examining distributions and relationships within the data.
3. **Visualization**: Creating interactive charts and graphs to present insights visually.

## Dashboard Overview

The final dashboard is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of the analysis:

- **Average Income per Purchase**: Compares the average income of customers who purchased a bike versus those who did not, broken down by gender.
- **Customer Age Brackets**: Shows the number of customers in different age brackets (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old) and their likelihood of purchasing a bike.
- **Customer Commute**: Analyzes how commute distance influences bike purchase behavior, with distances ranging from 0-1 miles to more than 10 miles.
- **Filters**: Allows users to filter the data by Marital Status, Region, and Education Level to further explore specific customer segments.

## Key Findings

From the analysis, several important insights emerged:

- **Income vs. Purchase**:
  - Customers who purchased bikes had higher average incomes than those who did not. Males who bought bikes had the highest average income of around $60,124, while females who bought bikes had an average income of $55,774.
- **Age Bracket Trends**:
  - Middle-aged customers were the most likely to purchase a bike compared to adolescents and older adults. This suggests that marketing efforts could be targeted towards this age group for better results.
- **Commute Distance**:
  - Customers with shorter commute distances (0-1 miles) showed a higher likelihood of purchasing bikes. However, this likelihood drops off significantly as the commute distance increases beyond 5 miles.
- **Regional and Demographic Variations**:
  - By applying different filters such as marital status, region, and education level, more nuanced insights can be uncovered. For instance, targeting certain regions or educational backgrounds may yield higher conversion rates.

## How to Use the Dashboard

### Filters
Use the filters on the left side of the dashboard to explore data for specific groups of customers. For example, you can analyze bike purchases among married vs. single individuals, or compare trends across different regions.

### Charts and Graphs
The visualizations are interactive. Hover over data points to see more details, or select different options to adjust the charts accordingly.

### Detailed Sections
- **Average Income per Purchase**: 
  This section allows you to understand how income levels correlate with bike purchases, broken down by gender. Higher-income individuals tend to purchase bikes more frequently.

- **Customer Age Brackets**: 
  Shows trends across different age groups. It can help identify the target demographic for marketing campaigns.

- **Customer Commute**: 
  Highlights the relationship between commute distance and bike purchases. Shorter commutes appear to correlate with higher bike purchase rates.

## Future Improvements
- **Include More Data Points**: 
  Incorporating additional variables such as lifestyle factors, preferences, or seasonal trends could yield deeper insights.

- **Machine Learning Integration**: 
  Using predictive models to forecast bike purchases based on customer demographics and behavior.

- **Automating Data Refresh**: 
  Setting up a system for automated data updates to keep the dashboard current.
